 * Building your programming logic can take time and practice, but here are a few tips that can help you improve your skills:

1.Break down problems into smaller, manageable tasks: When faced with a complex problem, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can help you to better understand the problem and come up with a plan to solve it.

2.Understand the requirements: Before you start coding, make sure you fully understand the problem you're trying to solve, what inputs are expected, what output is expected and any constraints. This will help you to design an appropriate solution.

3.Use pseudocode: Pseudocode is a way of expressing the logic of a program in plain language, which can be helpful for outlining the steps you need to take to solve a problem. This can help you to organize your thoughts and identify any potential issues with your solution.

4.Write code incrementally: Instead of trying to write the entire program at once, it can be helpful to write small chunks of code and test them as you go. This will help you to catch any errors early on, and make it easier to debug your code.

5.Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice solving different types of problems, the better you will become at developing your own logic. Try to solve different types of problems, read other people's code and see how they solve problems.

6.Learn from your mistakes: When you encounter an error or a bug, take the time to understand why it happened and what you can do to prevent it from happening in the future. This will help you to improve your skills and avoid making the same mistake again.

7.Learn to debug: Debugging is an important part of the programming process, and being able to identify and fix errors in your code can help you to improve your programming logic. Learn to use debugging tools and techniques like console.log, breakpoints, and the browser's development tools.

8.Practice solving problems: The more problems you solve, the better you will become at identifying patterns and developing a logical approach to solving problems. Try to solve a variety of problems, from simple to more complex, to challenge yourself and improve your skills.

9.Learn the fundamentals: Understanding the basic concepts of programming such as data types, control flow, and algorithms is essential for building a strong programming logic. Make sure you have a good grasp of these concepts and continue to reinforce your understanding through practice and study.
